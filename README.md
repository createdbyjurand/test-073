## Specifications

The code sandbox above already contains a wireframe example of a tristate checkbox (non-functional) within a React + TypeScript framework. The challenge is to complete the code and produce a functional checkbox group that can accommodate 3 separate states – “all checked” / “none checked” / “some checked”.

We’re mainly interested in seeing:

State management
File structure
Clean code

## Restrictions

Logic should be written in React (no vanilla JS DOM interaction)
Logic should be written in TypeScript
External libraries are allowed as long as they are not managing the core logic of the component
